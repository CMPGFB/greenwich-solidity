# **Greenwich Token (GRN)**  

### **Overview**  
The **Greenwich Token (GRN)** is an ERC-20 utility token designed to grant holders access to premium information, such as PDFs or eBooks, through an on-chain purchase mechanism. The contract enables resource management, allowing the owner to add information resources with specific token-based pricing. Users can purchase access to these resources using Greenwich Tokens, which are then burned upon transaction, reducing the total supply over time.  

### **Key Features**  
- **ERC-20 Token Standard** â€“ Built on OpenZeppelinâ€™s ERC-20 implementation.  
- **Fixed Total Supply** â€“ 21,000 tokens minted at deployment.  
- **Resource Access Control** â€“ Users can purchase digital resources with tokens.  
- **Burn Mechanism** â€“ Tokens used for purchases are burned to control supply.  
- **Admin Management** â€“ Only the contract owner can add new resources and set pricing.

## **Contract Details**  

### **Deployment**  
The contract is deployed with:  
- **Name**: Greenwich  
- **Symbol**: GRN  
- **Decimals**: 18  
- **Initial Supply**: 21,000 GRN tokens (minted to the deployer)

## **Functions**  

### **1. `addResource(uint256 resourceId, string memory name, uint256 price)`**  
ðŸ“Œ *Admin-only function to add a new digital resource.*  

- **Parameters**:  
  - `resourceId` â€“ Unique ID for the resource.  
  - `name` â€“ Name of the resource (e.g., "Blockchain Basics PDF").  
  - `price` â€“ Cost of the resource in GRN tokens.  
- **Requirements**:  
  - The resource ID must not already exist.  
- **Emits Event**: `ResourceAdded(resourceId, name, price)`  

---

### **2. `purchaseAccess(uint256 resourceId)`**  
ðŸ“Œ *Allows users to purchase access to a resource by paying the required token amount.*  

- **Parameters**:  
  - `resourceId` â€“ The ID of the resource to purchase.  
- **Requirements**:  
  - The resource must exist.  
  - The caller must not already have access to the resource.  
  - The caller must have enough GRN tokens to make the purchase.  
- **Token Flow**:  
  - The required amount of GRN is transferred from the user to the contract.  
  - The contract immediately burns the tokens to reduce total supply.  
  - The user is granted access to the resource.  
- **Emits Event**: `ResourceAccessed(msg.sender, resourceId)`  

---

### **3. `hasAccess(address user, uint256 resourceId) â†’ bool`**  
ðŸ“Œ *Checks if a user has access to a specific resource.*  

- **Parameters**:  
  - `user` â€“ Address of the user.  
  - `resourceId` â€“ The ID of the resource.  
- **Returns**:  
  - `true` if the user has access, `false` otherwise.  

---

### **4. `getResourcePrice(uint256 resourceId) â†’ uint256`**  
ðŸ“Œ *Retrieves the price of a given resource.*  

- **Parameters**:  
  - `resourceId` â€“ The ID of the resource.  
- **Returns**:  
  - Price of the resource in GRN tokens.

## **Events**  

| Event Name        | Parameters                                           | Description |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `ResourceAccessed` | `address user`, `uint256 resourceId`                | Emitted when a user purchases access to a resource. |
| `ResourceAdded`   | `uint256 resourceId`, `string name`, `uint256 price` | Emitted when a new resource is added by the contract owner. |

---

## **Security Considerations**  

- **Owner Privileges**:  
  - Only the contract owner can add resources and set prices.  
- **Token Burning**:  
  - Tokens used for resource purchases are burned, ensuring a deflationary supply model.  
- **ERC-20 Compliance**:  
  - Follows the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 standard for security and compatibility.

## **How to Use**  

### **1. Deploying the Contract**  
Deploy using Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry with Solidity 0.8.20+. Ensure you provide the deployer address as the initial owner.  

### **2. Adding a Resource** *(Owner Only)*  
Call `addResource(resourceId, "My eBook", 500)` to add a resource priced at 500 GRN tokens.  

### **3. Purchasing Access**  
Users call `purchaseAccess(resourceId)`, transferring tokens to the contract, which are then burned.  

### **4. Checking Access**  
Call `hasAccess(user, resourceId)` to verify if a user has access to a resource.
